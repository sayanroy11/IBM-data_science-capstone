# IBM-data_science-capstone
Final capstone project to predict if Falcon 9 will land successfully in the first stage.

The repository contains all the notebooks pertaining to this data science project.
1. We start by collecting data from various sources through web scraping from spacex official website and wikipedia.
2. Some data cleaning steps are performed to fill missing values, encode categoricals and remove unnecessary columns.
3. We write some queries using sqlite to perform some exploratory data analysis and capture some key findings.
4. Similarly we perform data visualization to get some more insights about the data.
5. We build some dashboards using Dash and plotly to allow users to interact with the data and to get an understanding of the key findings.
6. Finally we perform some predictive analysis to get results using various classification algorithms and also generate the confusion matrices.
7. The detailed analysis of the project has been demonstrated in a presentation.
